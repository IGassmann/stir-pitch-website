00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,800
Hey guys, my name is Igor and I'm a Product Engineer.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,100
I found out about Stir while listening to the Means of Creation podcast with Joe.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,700
Man! I was so impressed by it.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,000
I saw how you guys went above and beyond to help creators grow their businesses.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,400
From helping airrack reaching 1 million subscribers to helping Mixer streamers

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,400
migrate their followers.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,800
You guys show a customer obsession that I also share.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,100
I've been following creators for more than 10 years now.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,000
I still remember the time from Taking the Hobbits to Isengard...

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,500
Nyan Cat...

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,400
Rick Roll...

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,100
And following the early days of Smosh and MysteryGuitarMan.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm so obsessed with creators that I'm actually even dating and living

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,500
with one.

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,600
And that's me.

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,400
I started working in the creator economy more than three years ago when I joined LBRY.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,800
A startup that helps create their own and sell their content by having it published

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,600
on a blockchain.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,200
Sometime later, I co-founded Odeon which is a video platform that helps creators

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,400
bundle their subscription offering with other creators.

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,600
We worked relentlessly full-time for almost three years with creators on our side.

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,100
I recently left Odeon.

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,300
However, I still believe there's a lot to be built to satisfy the growing

24
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,300
needs of creators.

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,900
Startup founders already have a lot of infrastructure to help them build

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,800
and grow their business.

27
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,200
There is Stripe Atlas for helping start a company and Y Combinator for helping grow.

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,300
Creators don't have all of that...

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Yet.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,100
But it's only a question of time until they get the same level of support than

31
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,000
startup founders.

32
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,800
And Stir is perfectly positioned to move the needle in that direction.

33
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,100
A see Stir beeing at the forefront of that vision.

34
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,700
And that's why I want to work alongside with you to make that reality happen.

35
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,800
I have years of experience in building products for creators.

36
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,700
From helping design features on Figma.

37
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,900
To architecture an API on Node.js.

38
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,500
I've set up cloud infrastructures.

39
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,700
And handled operations in a startup.

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,100
I'm frequently talking with creators and interviewing them.

41
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,800
That helps me empathize with the problems they frequently encounter.

42
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,800
If I would get the opportunity to work alongside you, I would make sure to keep

43
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,300
that habbit.

44
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,700
That way I can also get early feedback and iterate faster with them.

45
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,300
I would help proactively.

46
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,200
Startup have diverse and often changing needs.

47
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,300
Switching roles has never been an issue for me.

48
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,600
If there's a problem with the servers.

49
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,000
I would be the one jumping right into it to solve it.

50
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,500
I hope this video finds you well, and that we get the chance to meet and talk

51
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,700
more about how I would provide value to you and the creators.

52
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:13,800
See ya.
